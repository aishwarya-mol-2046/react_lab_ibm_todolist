# 📝 React Todo List App

## 📘 Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a **dynamic Todo List application** using **React functional components** and **hooks**.  
It focuses on managing state effectively and organizing UI through component-based structure.

---

## ⚙️ Features Implemented
- ➕ Add multiple **todo sections** (each with a unique heading).  
- 🧾 Add **list items** under each heading.  
- ❌ Delete an entire heading section when no longer needed.  
- ⚡ Real-time updates using React’s `useState` hook for dynamic state changes.  
- 🎨 Clean user interface with separate styling (`TodoList.css`).

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered
In this lab, you learned how to:
1. Use **`useState`** to manage multiple state variables:
   - Store headings and nested list items.
   - Handle controlled input fields for dynamic lists.
2. Implement **dynamic rendering** using `map()` for iterating through arrays.
3. Create **interactive UIs** that respond to user actions (adding, deleting, updating lists).
4. Use **props and component structure** to organize a React app.
5. Manage **nested states** efficiently using immutable update patterns.

## 🚀 How to Run the Projects 
Use bash and run all the commands
1. Clone this repository:
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/react_lab_ibm_todolist.git

2. cd react_lab_ibm_todolist

3. npm install

4. npm start

Open your browser at http://localhost:3000 to view the app.

## 💡 Key Takeaways
React hooks (useState) simplify state management in function components.

You can manage multiple related states using JavaScript objects and arrays.

Controlled inputs keep the UI and state in sync.

Small, modular components make React apps easier to understand and extend.
